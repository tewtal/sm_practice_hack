# Presentation
## Negative Numbers
Infohud displays negative numbers as large positive numbers; this is sometimes referred to as number underflow. 
For example, at the start of moonfall when vertical speed underflows to a number between 0 and -1, 
the whole number portion of vertical speed will be presented as 65535. -2 is displayed as 65534, -3 is displayed as 65533, 
and so on.    

## Hexadecimal
Some numbers like subpixels represent fractions. For example, the max walking speed is 2.75 pixels per frame. 
However the fractional speed is not stored in a readable form like 0.75. 
Instead it is stored as 49152, since 49152/65536 = 0.75. 
The best way to efficiently display this information is to use hexadecimal or base-16 numbering format. 
In this example, the fractional speed converts from 49152 to C000 (hexadecimal uses 0-9 and A-F as the 16 digits).

## Samus HP
Most infohud and room strat options fit in the bottom left of the infohud, but some options will also cover up Samus HP. 
This will be noted in the descriptions below. Shine Tune also covers up the right side of the infohud including the segment timer 
and door transition frames.

# Infohud Mode features
## Enemy HP
Displays the HP of the first enemy. Most useful for boss fights, although Mother Brain uses the second enemy slot. For Mother Brain HP, you can select Room Strat, and then for the Room Strat select MB HP.

## Room Strat
Allows you to select a Room Strat instead of an Infohud Mode. See below section for the various Room Strats.

## Charge
Counts down the frames from the time you press shot until the time the beam would be charged. The timer resets if you let go of the shot button, and begins counting up the frames shot was released to the left of the charge timer.

## X Factor
Counts down the frames from the time you press shoot until the time the SBA (Special Beam Attack) would activate. The timer resets if you let go of the shoot button or if the SBA activates.

## Cooldown
Counts down the frames from time you activate a weapon or lay a bomb until the time you can fire again.

## Shinespark
Counts down the frames from the time you charge a shinespark until the time the charge runs out. If you activate the shinespark in time, it will display the number of frames to spare.

## Dash
Displays the speed boost counter. This number can be between 0 and 4. When building a shinespark charge, each successful tap (or held dash button) will increment the dash counter.

## Shine Tune
Displays the number of extra frames that dash was held while building a shinespark. There can be up to eight numbers.  
&nbsp;  
For example, consider the following 3-tap short charge: *9 2 10 0 ... 814 14 7*

- The first tap was a little early, with dash held 9 frames early and 2 frames late for a total of 12 frames (counting the magic frame). 
- The second tap was almost too early, with dash held 10 frames early and 0 frames late. 
- The third tap was pressed 8 frames early and held. We can see it was held because the next two numbers are the same and are 14 or larger. This indicates that the the third tap was held 14 frames late and the fourth tap was held 14 frames early, which really means the dash button was held.  

The last number is the frames it took to complete the charge by pressing down or for the charge to be cancelled. The first and last numbers can be rather large; in fact the first number will be displayed as XX if it is larger than 99. If you miss a tap then you will get early or late feedback on that. In this example if the second tap were one frame sooner then you would see:
9 2 11E1 ...
This indicates the second tap started 11 frames early and ended 1 frame too early.
For reference, on NTSC the magic frames are 25 frames apart between first and second tap, 20 frames apart between second and third tap, and 15 frames apart between third and fourth tap.
On PAL the magic frames are 20 frames apart between first and second tap, 20 frames apart between second and third tap, and 10 frames apart between third and fourth tap.

## I Frames
Counts down the invulnerability frames after Samus takes damage.

## Spikesuit
Displays feedback on the two inputs required to generate a spikesuit. It assumes you will be taking damage from spikes which give 60 I-frames and 10 frames of knockback. The feedback is as follows:  
&nbsp;  
First two characters = Feedback on the unmorph:
- E1 indicates you unmorphed the same frame you took damage, which is one frame early.
- E indicates you unmorphed two or more frames early.
- Y1 indicates you unmorphed on the first frame of the two-frame window, and Y2 indicates you unmorphed on the second frame.
- L# indicates you unmorphed late where the number tells you how many frames you were late.

Last two characters = Feedback on the shinespark activation:
- E# indicates you activated the spark early where the number tells you how many frames you were early.
- YY indicates you activated the spark on the correct frame.
- L# indicates you activated the spark late where the number tells you how many frames you were late.

If you get the feedback Y1E1, then this means you unmorphed after taking damage and activated the shinespark all before you ran out of knockback frames. This is known as the bad frame since Samus will do the shinespark but not give you a spikesuit. It is a double-frame-perfect mistake.

## CPU Usage
Counts down the number of scanlines that were drawn during processing of the next frame. The screen has a resolution of 256x224, so at 60 fps, 224 scanlines must be drawn every 1/60th of a second. This count is converted to a percentage to get a sense of the lag. The higher the percentage, the closer we were to not finishing processing in time. If processing does not finish in time, then the game must draw the current frame again and this is a lag frame. If the percentage is a low number, then it is likely the game lagged with most of the work done during the previous frame and a small amount of work left over for the next frame.

## X Position
Displays the X position in pixels. Also Samus HP is replaced by the subpixels in hexadecimal.

## Y Position
Displays the Y position in pixels. Also Samus HP is replaced by the subpixels in hexadecimal.

## Horiz Speed
Displays the horizontal speed combined with momentum in pixels. Also Samus HP is replaced by the subpixels in hexadecimal.

## Vert Speed
Displays the vertical speed in pixels. Initial jump speed will displayed as a three digit hex value, overwriting the item collection percentage. Samus HP will be overwritten with space jump feedback:
&nbsp;  
First two characters = Number of frames that the jump button was held.
&nbsp;  
Last two characters = Feedback on the time when you jumped, with respect to space jump.
- E# indicates you were early where the number tells you how many frames you were early.
- Y# indicates you made a valid space jump. On NTSC, you normally have 23 frames, but if underwater you have 41 frames. On PAL, you normally have 19 frames, but if underwater you have 28 frames.
- L# indicates you were late where the number tells you how many frames you were late.

## Quick Drop
Displays the number of frames between pressing a left or right input and another left or right input, if the number of frames is between 1 and 20.

## Wall Jump
Displays the number of frames between pressing a left or right input and pressing the jump button, if the number of frames is between 1 and 20. On NTSC, to walljump this number should be between 2 and 9 inclusive. Also, if the number of frames is 9 (required for a max-delayed walljump) and the walljump is taking place in WRITG, plasma room, or bubble mountain, then additional information may be presented if you appear to be making hi-jump bootless walljump attempts:
&nbsp;  
First two characters = Feedback on the max-delayed walljump:
- H# indicates you jumped high where the number tells you how many pixels you were high (can be zero).
- L# indicates you jumped low where the number tells you how many pixels you were low (can be zero).

Unfortunately there is no single pixel that is guaranteed to work for these specific walljumps; it also depends on the subpixels. If you get H0 9 or L0 9, then the jump is possible an estimated 75% of the time. With H0 9 you will know it is possible if you do not bonk the ledge.
Additionally Samus HP will be overwritten with the average climb speed in approximate pixels per frame (inflated by 2.4%). It averages vertical speed between jump presses, assuming the presses are within 2 seconds of each other and assuming the total speed does not overflow (if either of these happen then average will be blank). If total speed drops below zero then the average will be recorded as zero.
&nbsp;  
Note: This feature may not be as accurate on PAL. It will consider either a 7-frame or a 9-frame walljump as a max-delayed walljump (strangely an 8-frame delayed walljump does not work on PAL).

## Shot Timer
Displays the number of frames between pressing the shoot button.

## RAM Watch
Displays the value of two configurable memory addresses in bank $7E, $7F, or the first bank of SRAM. Values can also be "locked" or rewritten each frame while the RAM Watch HUD mode is enabled. These addresses and values can be configured in the 'Customize RAM Watch' submenu.

# Room strat features
## Parlor-Climb Door Skip
Provides feedback on attempts to get out of bounds while falling through the door from parlor to climb:  
&nbsp;  
First Y = You started from the correct position and you are holding jump (ready to do a buffered jump upon turning around). Currently only the non-moonfall starting position is accepted.
&nbsp;  
First two characters = Feedback on timing the first jump after pausing (this will overwrite the first Y):
- E# indicates you jumped early where the number tells you how many frames you were early.
- YY indicates you jumped on the correct frame.
- L# indicates you jumped late where the number tells you how many frames you were late.

Last two characters = Feedback on breaking out of the aim down pose:
- E# indicates you broke pose early where the number tells you how many frames you were early.
- YY indicates you broke pose on time.
- L1 indicates you broke pose one frame late. You will get this feedback just as you hit the door transition.
- LX indicates you broke pose more than one frame late. You will not get this feedback until after the door transition.

## Taco Tank
Provides feedback on attempts to collect the Retro Brinstar E-Tank using a precise walljump:  
&nbsp;  
First Y = You started from the correct position (pressed against the wall facing left).  
&nbsp;  
First character = Number of frames that you initially held left (this will replace the first Y). In order to get the proper momentum to walljump and collect the tank, this will need to be either 3 or 4.  
&nbsp;  
Second character = Number of frames after pressing left that jump was pressed. In order to get the proper momentum to walljump and collect the tank, this will need to be 3. It is normal for a 0 to appear when jumping straight up and down and shooting at the tank to reveal it.  
&nbsp;  
Next two characters = Feedback on the walljump height:  
- L# indicates you were low where the number tells you how many frames you were low.
- Y# (Y1-Y3) indicates you were at a good height, with # indicating the number of frames where you can grab the tank (based solely on walljump height).
- B# (B1-B3) indicates you will bonk the ceiling but can still collect the tank, with # indicating the number of frames where you can grab the tank (based solely on walljump height).
- H# indicates you were high where the number tells you how many frames you were high.

Additionally Samus HP will be overwritten with more feedback:  
&nbsp;  
First character = Number of pixels away from the wall when the walljump occurred. Ideally this will be 7. If it is more than 7 then you will not execute a walljump. If is it less than 7, then you are practically guaranteed to have fewer frames to collect the tank. For example, if you see Y2 6, then it is likely you will only have 1 frame to grab the tank instead of 2.  
&nbsp;  
Second character = Number of frames where you can collect the tank. This will take into account your walljump height, initial pixels away from the wall, and time when you break spin. For example, if you see Y2 71, then you broke spin too early and missed out on a frame to grab the tank. If you see an X, this means there was something wrong with the walljump right out of the gate, either because it was too high or low, or because it did not have the correct horizontal momentum. Even with a Y3 or B3 jump, it is not possible to reach the tank without the correct momentum.  
&nbsp;  
Last two characters = Feedback on the time when you expanded your hitbox to grab the tank:
- E# indicates you were early where the number tells you how many frames you were early.
- Y# indicates you had one chance to collect the tank.
- L# indicates you were late where the number tells you how many frames you were late.

Unfortunately even if you are coming in with a Y3 73 jump, you only get one chance to grab the tank. It does not matter if you choose Y1, Y2, or Y3 to attempt the grab, as it will come down to the collision oscillator. When Samus expands her hitbox, she will contact both the tank and the ceiling, but the game will only check one of the tiles. If it checks the ceiling tile, it will push Samus down and out of the ceiling and she will not be able to grab the tank on the next frame.

## Gate Glitch
Provides feedback on attempts to open a left-facing gate from the right side:  
&nbsp;  
First character = Number of frames where you could have fired a missile through the gate (0-2).  
&nbsp;  
Last two characters = Feedback on the timing of your shot (only visible if number of frames greater than 0):
- E# indicates you were early where the number tells you how many frames you were early.
- YY indicates you were on time with a one-frame window.
- Y1 indicates you shot on the first frame of a two-frame window, and Y2 indicates you shot on the second frame.
- L# indicates you were late where the number tells you how many frames you were late.

Note: This only gives feedback on whether the missile could have been fired through the gate. It does not predict if the missile would hit the blue or green switch that activates the gate.

## Moat CWJ (currently only supported on NTSC)
Provides feedback on attempts to cross the moat using a Continuous Wall Jump:  
&nbsp;  
First Y = You started from the correct position. Acceptable starting positions are in the previous room pressed against the door, or are as far left as possible in the moat room with the door open. Other positions may work for moat CWJ, but these are the two normalized positions providing a good chance of success. If you try other starting positions, the trick may become more difficult (double-frame-perfect) or even impossible.  
&nbsp;  
First two characters = Feedback on the first jump (this will overwrite the first Y):
- E# indicates you jumped early where the number tells you how many frames you were early.
- YY indicates you jumped on the correct frame, which is the last frame before you fall into the water.
- L# indicates you jumped late where the number tells you how many frames you were late.

Last two characters = Feedback on the second jump:
- Blank indicates the game did not register your second jump. This can happen if you are collecting the missile pack and then press jump too soon as the fanfare box is closing.
- E# indicates you jumped early where the number tells you how many frames you were early.
- Y1 indicates you jumped on the first frame of the two-frame window, and Y2 indicates you jumped on the second frame.
- L# indicates you jumped late where the number tells you how many frames you were late.

Note: If you started from inside the moat room (as far left as possible in the room), it is possible to observe YYY2 and miss the jump. Since Samus has a subpixel position, even when Samus appears to be as far left as possible, she may need to be even further left in subpixels in order to get a two-frame window on the second jump. A majority of subpixels work. Also if you start from outside the moat room then it is always a two-frame window regardless of subpixels.

## Robot Flush
Provides feedback on attempts to flush the two robots in the Bowling Alley:
- First 1 = The first robot was hit by a beam shot.
- Second 1 = The first robot fell down.
- First 2 = The second robot was hit by a beam shot.
- Second 2 = The second robot fell down.

Thus 1122 indicates both robots were successfully flushed.

## Shine to PB
Similar to shinespark, except Samus HP is overwritten to display information for the power bomb. Counts down the frames from the time you charge a shinespark until the time the charge runs out. If you activate the shinespark in time, it will display the number of frames to spare. If you lay a power bomb, it will display the number of frames to spare.

## Elevator Crystal Flash
Provides feedback on attempts to crystal flash while initiating a downward elevator on the same frame, which grants Samus a spikesuit:  
&nbsp;  
First character = Feedback on the power bomb:
- Y indicates you were at the correct height.
- X indicates you were not at the correct height.
- % indicates you were at the horizontal center of the elevator (regardless of whether or not you were at the correct height). Laying the power bomb at the center is risky since, if you mistime the down input, it is possible for the crystal flash to activate after Samus has started travelling down the elevator, which is likely a run-ending mistake.

Second Y = You returned to the same X and Y location (within 3 seconds or so) and you had 0 vertical speed. You should also have 0 horizontal speed although this is not checked.

Last two characters = Feedback on your timing in pressing down at the correct position:
- E# indicates you were early where the number tells you how many frames you were early.
- YY indicates you were on time. If you did not get the spikesuit, it could mean you were not holding the correct inputs (you must hold only L, R, and shoot, in addition to pressing down on the correct frame), or it could mean you did not meet the conditions for a crystal flash. You must have 10+ missiles, 10+ super missiles, 10+ power bombs, and be below 50 HP with empty reserves (having non-empty reserves to manual will prevent a crystal flash). It is often stated that you need 11+ power bombs, but that is counting the power bomb you laid at the beginning of the crystal flash clip attempt.
- L# indicates you were late where the number tells you how many frames you were late.

Note: This will also give feedback on the power bomb height in the Dachora room, in order to convert a spikesuit into a blue suit by interrupting the shinespark animation with a crystal flash.

## Botwoon Crystal Flash
Provides feedback on attempts to crystal flash clip in Botwoon Hallway:  
&nbsp;  
First Y = You laid a power bomb at the correct height (maximum height that you can).
&nbsp;  
Second Y = You returned to the same X and Y location (within 3 seconds or so) and you had 0 vertical speed. You should also have 0 horizontal speed although this is not checked.

Last two characters = Feedback on your timing in returning to the correct position:
- E# indicates you were early where the number tells you how many frames you were early.
- YY indicates you were on time. If you did not get the crystal flash, it could mean you were not holding the correct inputs (you must hold only L, R, down, and shoot), or it could mean you did not meet the conditions for a crystal flash. You must have 10+ missiles, 10+ super missiles, 10+ power bombs, and be below 50 HP with empty reserves (having non-empty reserves to manual will prevent a crystal flash). It is often stated that you need 11+ power bombs, but that is counting the power bomb you laid at the beginning of the crystal flash clip attempt.
- L# indicates you were late where the number tells you how many frames you were late.

Note: If using the bombs method, there is a two-frame window where Samus will reach the correct position with 0 speed for two frames. In this case, you will get your best case feedback. For example, instead of seeing YYL2 followed by YYL3, you will just see YYL2.

## Aqueduct Snail Clip
Provides feedback on attempts to stop a particular snail in a position where you can jump up and clip through pipes to reach the two Aqueduct items:  
&nbsp;  
Last two characters = Feedback on your timing in returning to the correct position:
- H# indicates the snail is too high where the number tells you how many pixels it is high.
- YH indicates the snail is in the highest of the three or four pixels where the clip works.
- Y  indicates the snail is in the middle of the three or four pixels where the clip works.
- YL indicates the snail is in the lowest of the three or four pixels where the clip works.
- L# indicates the snail is too low where the number tells you how many pixels it is low.

Note: Snail clip works with three pixels on NTSC and four pixels on PAL. This assumes subpixel position is irrelevant, and assumes hi jump boots have no effect.

## Three Jump Baby Skip (NTSC)
Provides feedback on attempts to perform the baby skip without space jump and only three jumps. On NTSC, this is very specific.
This method assumes a normalized start and full first jump, but there may be other methods to perform this trick.
&nbsp;  
First Y = You started from the correct position (pressed against the bump on the floor facing left).  
&nbsp;  
First two pairs of characters = Feedback on start of first run and start of first jump (this will replace the first Y):
- E# indicates you were early to start running and/or start jumping
- YY indicates you started running and/or started jumping on time
- L# indicates you were late to start running and/or start jumping

Additionally Samus HP will be overwritten with more feedback on start of second run, start of second jump and release of second jump:  
&nbsp;  
- E# indicates you were early to start running/jumping/releasing jump
- Y# indicates you started running/jumping/releasing jump on time*
- L# indicates you were late to start running/jumping/releasing jump

*Unfortunately not all combinations work, and you may also find combinations that work despite being early or late.
For example, when testing (at reduced speed) YYYYY1Y1Y1 did not work while YYYYE1E1Y2 did.

## Three Jump Baby Skip (PAL)
Provides feedback on attempts to perform the baby skip without space jump and only three jumps. On PAL, Samus has superior movement compared to the baby making this trick less specific.
This method assumes a normalized start and full first jump, but there may be other methods to perform this trick.
&nbsp;  
First Y = You started from the correct position (pressed against the bump on the floor facing left).  
&nbsp;  
First two characters = Feedback on start of first run (this will replace the first Y):
- E# indicates you were early to start running (although the trick may still work)
- Y# indicates you started running on time
- L# indicates you were late to start running (although the trick may still work)
&nbsp;  
Next two characters = Feedback on start of first jump:
&nbsp;  
- E# indicates you were early to start jumping (the trick is much less likely to work)
- YY indicates you started jumping on time
- L# indicates you were late start jumping (the trick will not work since you will bonk)

Additionally Samus HP will be overwritten with more feedback on release of second jump:  
&nbsp;  
- E# indicates you were early to release jump (although the trick may still work)
- Y# indicates you released jump on time (although Y2 may cause you to bonk the dust hopper)
- L# indicates you were late to release jump (although the trick may still work)

Note: The last jump on PAL is different from NTSC, since Samus is quite slow morphed and in the air on PAL.
You may want to start the last jump unmorphed and then only morph after bonking the ceiling and approaching the ground.
It is also possible to get through without morphing at all (walljump check recommended to trigger the door transition sooner).

## Mother Brain HP
Displays the HP of the second enemy. Most useful for the Mother Brain fight since Mother Brain uses the second enemy slot.
<br />
