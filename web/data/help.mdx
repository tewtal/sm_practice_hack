| - Room Strat                  | Select which Room Strat to be displayed in the bottom-left of the HUD. 
|                               | This only works if "Room Strat" is selected as the above Infohud Mode.
| - Frame Counters              | Toggle the room timer in the top-right of the HUD between realtime and gametime
| - Reset Segment in Next Room  | Sets the segment timer to reset automatically when exiting the next door transition.
| - Status Icons                | Toggle icons to appear when standing on an elevator or when the shine timer is active (e.g. while carrying a spikesuit).
| - Artificial Lag              | Select a value to adjust how much lag occurs during normal gameplay. 
|                               | This is to compensate for the lack of a minimap on the HUD which would normally consume CPU cycles.
| - Customize RAM Watch         | Setup addresses to be monitored by the RAM Watch HUD mode. Address 1 will appear in the bottom-left corner of the HUD, while Address 2 appears just to the right of Address 1. Memory at these locations can be edited by configuring a Value and selecting 'Write to Address'. Toggle 'Lock Value' to automatically write the value once every frame. RAM Watch must must be the selected HUD mode to continue writing to the address. Only one byte of hex can be configured at a time in the menu. 'Hi' refers to the first byte, while 'Lo' refers to the second. Set the Hi Address to 0D and the Lo Address to EC to monitor the memory address $0DEC, which stores the counter for Samus direction changes while held by Draygon (among other uses).

This allows you to navigate OOB (Out of Bounds) areas where neither Samus nor the actual tiles are visible in-game. Samus hitbox is drawn at the center of the overlay to show the position relative to the tiles.

|                               | **Note**: It is not possible for both claws to spawn above Kraid, so there will always be some lag generated by a claw below.

# Lag Frames

Super Metroid runs at ~60 fps (NTSC) or ~50 fps (PAL). On each frame, the game simultaneously renders the current frame while preparing the next frame. If it fails to prepare the next frame in time, then the previous frame is rendered again. We call this a lag frame.
This means that game lag depends on how much work the CPU needs to do to prepare the next frame. It follows that any modification to game code could impact the game lag. Thus we need to balance the desire for practice ROM features with the desire for performance accuracy (matching the actual game lag).
&nbsp;  
You might be wondering how we were able to add features at all, since generally adding features means adding work. In fact even if a feature is toggled off, the game may have to check that the feature is toggled off and that is more work.
Fortunately it was discovered that the minimap adds a noticeable amount of work to each frame, and by disabling the minimap we freed up CPU for our features. In fact, we even had to add artificial lag in order to more closely match actual game performance.
Unfortunately we weren't the only ones to notice this. Deer Force knew, and they also knew boss fights were laggy, so they disabled the minimap for most boss fights.
As a result, with default settings the practice ROM will have very similar lag compared to the actual game, except the practice ROM may have more lag during boss fights.
&nbsp;  
As we continue to maintain and add features to the practice ROM, this is our strategy for managing lag:

| <th width="600" />            |       |
| :---                          | :---  |
| - Normal Gameplay             | With default settings (enemy HP selected in the infohud), we really try not to change lag. If we do, it will be communicated.
|                               | If you select other infohud or room strat options, lag may have a slight variance although it typically won't be noticeable.
| - Events                      | On events (when drops appear, when an item is collected, etc.), we may add features. It's conceivable this could add a lag frame, although in most circumstances it would be unlikely or impossible.
| - Door/Elevator Transitions   | Similar to events, we may add features during this time. Some features require data to be reloaded during this time.
| - Practice Features           | Once you start turning on practice features, lag may no longer be similar to actual game. Some features like magic pants or the metronome may not have much impact, but others like the OOB tile viewer add a significant amount of work for the CPU.
| - Sprite Patches              | Sprite patches such as SpriteSomething should be supported. These patches sometimes modify the game and theoretically could affect lag on their own, although if you intend to play the vanilla game or randomizer with a sprite patch then you might as well apply it to the practice ROM.
