For example, at the start of moonfall when vertical speed underflows to a number between 0 and -1,
the whole number portion of vertical speed will be presented as 65535. -2 is displayed as 65534, -3 is displayed as 65533,
and so on.    </p><h2 class="mx-2 text-lg font-bold mt-4">Hexadecimal</h2><p class="mx-4">Some numbers like subpixels represent fractions. For example, the max walking speed is 2.75 pixels per frame.
However the fractional speed is not stored in a readable form like 0.75.
Instead it is stored as 49152, since 49152/65536 = 0.75.
The best way to efficiently display this information is to use hexadecimal or base-16 numbering format.
In this example, the fractional speed converts from 49152 to C000 (hexadecimal uses 0-9 and A-F as the 16 digits).</p><h2 class="mx-2 text-lg font-bold mt-4">Samus HP</h2><p class="mx-4">Most infohud and room strat options fit in the bottom left of the infohud, but some options will also cover up Samus HP.
This will be noted in the descriptions below. Shine Tune also covers up the right side of the infohud including the segment timer
and door transition frames.</p><div class="p-4 mb-4 mt-8 bg-blue-100 text-blue-500 rounded shadow-sm font-sans font-bold">Infohud Mode features</div><h2 class="mx-2 text-lg font-bold mt-4">Enemy HP</h2><p class="mx-4">Displays the HP of the first enemy. Most useful for boss fights, although Mother Brain uses the second enemy slot. For Mother Brain HP, you can select Room Strat, and then for the Room Strat select MB HP.</p><h2 class="mx-2 text-lg font-bold mt-4">Room Strat</h2><p class="mx-4">Allows you to select a Room Strat instead of an Infohud Mode. See below section for the various Room Strats.</p><h2 class="mx-2 text-lg font-bold mt-4">Charge</h2><p class="mx-4">Counts down the frames from the time you press shot until the time the beam would be charged. The timer resets if you let go of the shot button, and begins counting up the frames shot was released to the left of the charge timer.</p><h2 class="mx-2 text-lg font-bold mt-4">X Factor</h2><p class="mx-4">Counts down the frames from the time you press shoot until the time the SBA (Special Beam Attack) would activate. The timer resets if you let go of the shoot button or if the SBA activates.</p><h2 class="mx-2 text-lg font-bold mt-4">Cooldown</h2><p class="mx-4">Counts down the frames from time you activate a weapon or lay a bomb until the time you can fire again.</p><h2 class="mx-2 text-lg font-bold mt-4">Shinespark</h2><p class="mx-4">Counts down the frames from the time you charge a shinespark until the time the charge runs out. If you activate the shinespark in time, it will display the number of frames to spare.</p><h2 class="mx-2 text-lg font-bold mt-4">Dash</h2><p class="mx-4">Displays the speed boost counter. This number can be between 0 and 4. When building a shinespark charge, each successful tap (or held dash button) will increment the dash counter.</p><h2 class="mx-2 text-lg font-bold mt-4">Shine Tune</h2><p class="mx-4">Displays the number of extra frames that dash was held while building a shinespark. There can be up to eight numbers.<br/>
<br/>
<!-- -->For example, consider the following 3-tap short charge: <em>9 2 10 0 ... 814 14 7</em></p><ul class="list-disc ml-8 mb-4 text-md"><li>The first tap was a little early, with dash held 9 frames early and 2 frames late for a total of 12 frames (counting the magic frame). </li><li>The second tap was almost too early, with dash held 10 frames early and 0 frames late. </li><li>The third tap was pressed 8 frames early and held. We can see it was held because the next two numbers are the same and are 14 or larger. This indicates that the the third tap was held 14 frames late and the fourth tap was held 14 frames early, which really means the dash button was held.  </li></ul><p class="mx-4">The last number is the frames it took to complete the charge by pressing down or for the charge to be cancelled. The first and last numbers can be rather large; in fact the first number will be displayed as XX if it is larger than 99. If you miss a tap then you will get early or late feedback on that. In this example if the second tap were one frame sooner then you would see:
9 2 11E1 ...
This indicates the second tap started 11 frames early and ended 1 frame too early.
For reference, on NTSC the magic frames are 25 frames apart between first and second tap, 20 frames apart between second and third tap, and 15 frames apart between third and fourth tap.
On PAL the magic frames are 20 frames apart between first and second tap, 20 frames apart between second and third tap, and 10 frames apart between third and fourth tap.</p><p class="mx-4">There is also an &quot;average starting momentum&quot; number printed out which gives some feedback on how effective the start of the short charge was.
Even a single stutter will lower this number from above 2 to below 2, but you can reduce the number further with more stutters.
It also accounts for the amount of the time the dpad was released, since each frame the dpad is released while decelerating, Samus moves an extra pixel forward, so shorter releases of the dpad are more optimal.</p><h2 class="mx-2 text-lg font-bold mt-4">I Frames</h2><p class="mx-4">Counts down the invulnerability frames after Samus takes damage.</p><h2 class="mx-2 text-lg font-bold mt-4">Spikesuit</h2><p class="mx-4">Displays feedback on the two inputs required to generate a spikesuit. It assumes you will be taking damage from spikes which give 60 I-frames and 10 frames of knockback. The feedback is as follows:<br/>
<br/>
<!-- -->First two characters = Feedback on the unmorph:</p><ul class="list-disc ml-8 mb-4 text-md"><li>E1 indicates you unmorphed the same frame you took damage, which is one frame early.</li><li>E indicates you unmorphed two or more frames early.</li><li>Y1 indicates you unmorphed on the first frame of the two-frame window, and Y2 indicates you unmorphed on the second frame.</li><li>L# indicates you unmorphed late where the number tells you how many frames you were late.</li></ul><p class="mx-4">Last two characters = Feedback on the shinespark activation:</p><ul class="list-disc ml-8 mb-4 text-md"><li>E# indicates you activated the spark early where the number tells you how many frames you were early.</li><li>YY indicates you activated the spark on the correct frame.</li><li>L# indicates you activated the spark late where the number tells you how many frames you were late.</li></ul><p class="mx-4">If you get the feedback Y1E1, then this means you unmorphed after taking damage and activated the shinespark all before you ran out of knockback frames. This is known as the bad frame since Samus will do the shinespark but not give you a spikesuit. It is a double-frame-perfect mistake.</p><h2 class="mx-2 text-lg font-bold mt-4">CPU Usage</h2><p class="mx-4">Counts down the number of scanlines that were drawn during processing of the next frame. The screen has a resolution of 256x224, so at 60 fps, 224 scanlines must be drawn every 1/60th of a second. This count is converted to a percentage to get a sense of the lag. The higher the percentage, the closer we were to not finishing processing in time. If processing does not finish in time, then the game must draw the current frame again and this is a lag frame. If the percentage is a low number, then it is likely the game lagged with most of the work done during the previous frame and a small amount of work left over for the next frame.</p><h2 class="mx-2 text-lg font-bold mt-4">X Position</h2><p class="mx-4">Displays the X position in pixels. Also Samus HP is replaced by the subpixels in hexadecimal.</p><h2 class="mx-2 text-lg font-bold mt-4">Y Position</h2><p class="mx-4">Displays the Y position in pixels. Also Samus HP is replaced by the subpixels in hexadecimal.</p><h2 class="mx-2 text-lg font-bold mt-4">Horiz Speed</h2><p class="mx-4">Displays the horizontal speed combined with momentum in pixels. Also Samus HP is replaced by the subpixels in hexadecimal.</p><h2 class="mx-2 text-lg font-bold mt-4">Vert Speed</h2><p class="mx-4">Displays the vertical speed in pixels. Initial jump speed will displayed as a three digit hex value, overwriting the item collection percentage. Samus HP will be overwritten with space jump feedback:
<!-- --> <br/>
<!-- -->First two characters = Number of frames that the jump button was held.
<!-- --> <br/>
<!-- -->Last two characters = Feedback on the time when you jumped, with respect to space jump.</p><ul class="list-disc ml-8 mb-4 text-md"><li>E# indicates you were early where the number tells you how many frames you were early.</li><li>Y# indicates you made a valid space jump. On NTSC, you normally have 23 frames, but if underwater you have 41 frames. On PAL, you normally have 19 frames, but if underwater you have 28 frames.</li><li>L# indicates you were late where the number tells you how many frames you were late.</li></ul><h2 class="mx-2 text-lg font-bold mt-4">Quick Drop</h2><p class="mx-4">Displays the number of frames between pressing a left or right input and another left or right input, if the number of frames is between 1 and 20. If a down input is pressed, then feedback on mid-air morph bomb spread will be given:
<!-- --> <br/>
<!-- -->First two characters = Feedback on mid-air morph while beam is charged:</p><ul class="list-disc ml-8 mb-4 text-md"><li>E# indicates you were early where the number tells you how many frames you were early.</li><li>YY indicates you attempted to morph on the correct frame.</li><li>L# indicates you were late where the number tells you how many frames you were late.</li></ul><h2 class="mx-2 text-lg font-bold mt-4">Wall Jump</h2><p class="mx-4">Displays the number of frames between pressing a left or right input and pressing the jump button, if the number of frames is between 1 and 20.
To walljump this number should be between 2 and 9 inclusive, although on PAL 8 does not work due to Samus&#x27; animation running out and being in the incorrect pose on that particular frame.
Also, if the number of frames is 7-9 (a delayed walljump) and the walljump is taking place in WRITG or bubble mountain, then additional information may be presented if you appear to be making hi-jump-less walljump attempts (also known as the hypo jump):
<!-- --> <br/>
<!-- -->First two characters = Feedback on the delayed walljump:</p><ul class="list-disc ml-8 mb-4 text-md"><li>H# indicates you jumped high where the number tells you how many pixels you were high (can be zero in bubble mountain; H0 does not work and will bonk).</li><li>B# indicates you jumped high and will bonk, but could save it with a quick mid-air wiggle (turn and turn back). This wiggle shrinks Samus&#x27; hitbox.
It only works in WRITG. The number is the most amount of frames you can take to wiggle, with larger numbers indicating your jump was closer to the optimal YH position.</li><li>YH indicates you jumped at the optimum height with an 8 or 9 frame walljump.</li><li>YY indicates you jumped just below the optimum height with a 9 frame walljump (PAL only since PAL physics allow for a larger range of heights to work, although it must be a max-delayed 9 frame walljump since 8 frames won&#x27;t work).</li><li>YL indicates you jumped below optimum height with an 8 or 9 frame walljump. Generally a YL height is still enough height to get the second walljump without too much trouble.</li><li>L0 indicates you jumped below optimum height with a 7-9 frame walljump. L0 jumps still work but the second walljump can be very tight. L0 jumps are the only ones that work with a 7-frame delayed walljump, so for a more optimal setup you want an 8 or 9 frame walljump.</li><li>L# indicates you jumped low where the number tells you how many pixels you were low.</li></ul><p class="mx-4">Additionally Samus HP will be overwritten with the average climb speed in approximate pixels per frame (inflated by 2.4%). It averages vertical speed between jump presses, assuming the presses are within 2 seconds of each other and assuming the total speed does not overflow (if either of these happen then average will be blank). If total speed drops below zero then the average will be recorded as zero.</p><h2 class="mx-2 text-lg font-bold mt-4">Arm Pump</h2><p class="mx-4">Displays the number of armpumps (pose changes) per second, and the number of wasted angle down and/or angle up inputs per second.
An input is considered wasted if it does not change the pose, or if both angle down and angle up are changed on the same frame.
When exiting the room, the totals for the room are displayed.
Note that the specific pose is not actually checked, so other actions performed by Samus may be counted.</p><h2 class="mx-2 text-lg font-bold mt-4">Shot Timer</h2><p class="mx-4">Displays the number of frames between pressing the shoot button.</p><h2 class="mx-2 text-lg font-bold mt-4">RAM Watch</h2><p class="mx-4">Displays the value of two configurable memory addresses in bank $7E, $7F, or the first bank of SRAM. Values can also be &quot;locked&quot; or rewritten each frame while the RAM Watch HUD mode is enabled. These addresses and values can be configured in the &#x27;Customize RAM Watch&#x27; submenu.</p><div class="p-4 mb-4 mt-8 bg-blue-100 text-blue-500 rounded shadow-sm font-sans font-bold">Room strat features</div><h2 class="mx-2 text-lg font-bold mt-4">Parlor-Climb Door Skip</h2><p class="mx-4">Provides feedback on attempts to get out of bounds while falling through the door from parlor to climb:<br/>
<br/>
<!-- -->First Y = You started from the correct position and you are holding jump (ready to do a buffered jump upon turning around). Currently only the non-moonfall starting position is accepted.
<!-- --> <br/>
<!-- -->First two characters = Feedback on timing the first jump after pausing (this will overwrite the first Y):</p><ul class="list-disc ml-8 mb-4 text-md"><li>E# indicates you jumped early where the number tells you how many frames you were early.</li><li>YY indicates you jumped on the correct frame.</li><li>L# indicates you jumped late where the number tells you how many frames you were late.</li></ul><p class="mx-4">Last two characters = Feedback on breaking out of the aim down pose:</p><ul class="list-disc ml-8 mb-4 text-md"><li>E# indicates you broke pose early where the number tells you how many frames you were early.</li><li>YY indicates you broke pose on time.</li><li>L1 indicates you broke pose one frame late. You will get this feedback just as you hit the door transition.</li><li>LX indicates you broke pose more than one frame late. You will not get this feedback until after the door transition.</li></ul><h2 class="mx-2 text-lg font-bold mt-4">Taco Tank</h2><p class="mx-4">Provides feedback on attempts to collect the Retro Brinstar E-Tank using a precise walljump:<br/>
<br/>
<!-- -->First Y = You started from the correct position (pressed against the wall facing left).<br/>
<br/>
<!-- -->First character = Number of frames that you initially held left (this will replace the first Y). In order to get the proper momentum to walljump and collect the tank, this will need to be either 3 or 4.<br/>
<br/>
<!-- -->Second character = Number of frames after pressing left that jump was pressed. In order to get the proper momentum to walljump and collect the tank, this will need to be 3. It is normal for a 0 to appear when jumping straight up and down and shooting at the tank to reveal it.<br/>
<br/>
<!-- -->Next two characters = Feedback on the walljump height:  </p><ul class="list-disc ml-8 mb-4 text-md"><li>L# indicates you were low where the number tells you how many frames you were low.</li><li>Y# (Y1-Y3) indicates you were at a good height, with # indicating the number of frames where you can grab the tank (based solely on walljump height).</li><li>B# (B1-B3) indicates you will bonk the ceiling but can still collect the tank, with # indicating the number of frames where you can grab the tank (based solely on walljump height).</li><li>H# indicates you were high where the number tells you how many frames you were high.</li></ul><p class="mx-4">Additionally Samus HP will be overwritten with more feedback:<br/>
<br/>
<!-- -->First character = Number of pixels away from the wall when the walljump occurred. Ideally this will be 7. If it is more than 7 then you will not execute a walljump. If is it less than 7, then you are practically guaranteed to have fewer frames to collect the tank. For example, if you see Y2 6, then it is likely you will only have 1 frame to grab the tank instead of 2.<br/>
<br/>
<!-- -->Second character = Number of frames where you can collect the tank. This will take into account your walljump height, initial pixels away from the wall, and time when you break spin. For example, if you see Y2 71, then you broke spin too early and missed out on a frame to grab the tank. If you see an X, this means there was something wrong with the walljump right out of the gate, either because it was too high or low, or because it did not have the correct horizontal momentum. Even with a Y3 or B3 jump, it is not possible to reach the tank without the correct momentum.<br/>
<br/>
<!-- -->Last two characters = Feedback on the time when you expanded your hitbox to grab the tank:</p><ul class="list-disc ml-8 mb-4 text-md"><li>E# indicates you were early where the number tells you how many frames you were early.</li><li>Y# indicates you had one chance to collect the tank.</li><li>L# indicates you were late where the number tells you how many frames you were late.</li></ul><p class="mx-4">Unfortunately even if you are coming in with a Y3 73 jump, you only get one chance to grab the tank. It does not matter if you choose Y1, Y2, or Y3 to attempt the grab, as it will come down to the collision oscillator. When Samus expands her hitbox, she will contact both the tank and the ceiling, but the game will only check one of the tiles. If it checks the ceiling tile, it will push Samus down and out of the ceiling and she will not be able to grab the tank on the next frame.</p><h2 class="mx-2 text-lg font-bold mt-4">Gate Glitch</h2><p class="mx-4">Provides feedback on attempts to open a left-facing gate from the right side:<br/>
<br/>
<!-- -->First character = Number of frames where you could have fired a missile through the gate (0-2).<br/>
<br/>
<!-- -->Last two characters = Feedback on the timing of your shot (only visible if number of frames greater than 0):</p><ul class="list-disc ml-8 mb-4 text-md"><li>E# indicates you were early where the number tells you how many frames you were early.</li><li>YY indicates you were on time with a one-frame window.</li><li>Y1 indicates you shot on the first frame of a two-frame window, and Y2 indicates you shot on the second frame.</li><li>L# indicates you were late where the number tells you how many frames you were late.</li></ul><p class="mx-4">Note: This only gives feedback on whether the missile could have been fired through the gate. It does not predict if the missile would hit the blue or green switch that activates the gate.</p><h2 class="mx-2 text-lg font-bold mt-4">Moat CWJ (currently only supported on NTSC)</h2><p class="mx-4">Provides feedback on attempts to cross the moat using a Continuous Wall Jump:<br/>
<br/>
<!-- -->First Y = You started from the correct position. Acceptable starting positions are in the previous room pressed against the door, or are as far left as possible in the moat room with the door open. Other positions may work for moat CWJ, but these are the two normalized positions providing a good chance of success. If you try other starting positions, the trick may become more difficult (double-frame-perfect) or even impossible.<br/>
<br/>
<!-- -->First two characters = Feedback on the first jump (this will overwrite the first Y):</p><ul class="list-disc ml-8 mb-4 text-md"><li>E# indicates you jumped early where the number tells you how many frames you were early.</li><li>YY indicates you jumped on the correct frame, which is the last frame before you fall into the water.</li><li>L# indicates you jumped late where the number tells you how many frames you were late.</li></ul><p class="mx-4">Last two characters = Feedback on the second jump:</p><ul class="list-disc ml-8 mb-4 text-md"><li>Blank indicates the game did not register your second jump. This can happen if you are collecting the missile pack and then press jump too soon as the fanfare box is closing.</li><li>E# indicates you jumped early where the number tells you how many frames you were early.</li><li>Y1 indicates you jumped on the first frame of the two-frame window, and Y2 indicates you jumped on the second frame.</li><li>L# indicates you jumped late where the number tells you how many frames you were late.</li></ul><p class="mx-4">Note: If you started from inside the moat room (as far left as possible in the room), it is possible to observe YYY2 and miss the jump. Since Samus has a subpixel position, even when Samus appears to be as far left as possible, she may need to be even further left in subpixels in order to get a two-frame window on the second jump. A majority of subpixels work. Also if you start from outside the moat room then it is always a two-frame window regardless of subpixels.</p><h2 class="mx-2 text-lg font-bold mt-4">Robot Flush</h2><p class="mx-4">Provides feedback on attempts to flush the two robots in the Bowling Alley:</p><ul class="list-disc ml-8 mb-4 text-md"><li>First 1 = The first robot was hit by a beam shot.</li><li>Second 1 = The first robot fell down.</li><li>First 2 = The second robot was hit by a beam shot.</li><li>Second 2 = The second robot fell down.</li></ul><p class="mx-4">Thus 1122 indicates both robots were successfully flushed.</p><h2 class="mx-2 text-lg font-bold mt-4">Shine to PB</h2><p class="mx-4">Similar to shinespark, except Samus HP is overwritten to display information for the power bomb. Counts down the frames from the time you charge a shinespark until the time the charge runs out. If you activate the shinespark in time, it will display the number of frames to spare. If you lay a power bomb, it will display the number of frames to spare.</p><h2 class="mx-2 text-lg font-bold mt-4">Elevator Crystal Flash</h2><p class="mx-4">Provides feedback on attempts to crystal flash while initiating a downward elevator on the same frame, which grants Samus a spikesuit:<br/>
<br/>
<!-- -->First character = Feedback on the power bomb:</p><ul class="list-disc ml-8 mb-4 text-md"><li>Y indicates you were at the correct height.</li><li>X indicates you were not at the correct height.</li><li>% indicates you were at the horizontal center of the elevator (regardless of whether or not you were at the correct height). Laying the power bomb at the center is risky since, if you mistime the down input, it is possible for the crystal flash to activate after Samus has started travelling down the elevator, which is likely a run-ending mistake.</li></ul><p class="mx-4">Second Y = You returned to the same X and Y location (within 3 seconds or so) and you had 0 vertical speed. You should also have 0 horizontal speed although this is not checked.</p><p class="mx-4">Last two characters = Feedback on your timing in pressing down at the correct position:</p><ul class="list-disc ml-8 mb-4 text-md"><li>E# indicates you were early where the number tells you how many frames you were early.</li><li>YY indicates you were on time. If you did not get the spikesuit, it could mean you were not holding the correct inputs (you must hold only L, R, and shoot, in addition to pressing down on the correct frame), or it could mean you did not meet the conditions for a crystal flash. You must have 10+ missiles, 10+ super missiles, 10+ power bombs, and be below 50 HP with empty reserves (having non-empty reserves to manual will prevent a crystal flash). It is often stated that you need 11+ power bombs, but that is counting the power bomb you laid at the beginning of the crystal flash clip attempt.</li><li>L# indicates you were late where the number tells you how many frames you were late.</li></ul><p class="mx-4">Note: This will also give feedback on the power bomb height in the Dachora room, in order to convert a spikesuit into a blue suit by interrupting the shinespark animation with a crystal flash.</p><h2 class="mx-2 text-lg font-bold mt-4">Botwoon Crystal Flash</h2><p class="mx-4">Provides feedback on attempts to crystal flash clip in Botwoon Hallway (also works for East Pants Room):
<!-- --> <br/>
<!-- -->First Y = You laid a power bomb at the correct height (maximum height that you can).
<!-- --> <br/>
<!-- -->Second Y = You returned to the same X and Y location (within 3 seconds or so) and you had 0 vertical speed. You should also have 0 horizontal speed although this is not checked.</p><p class="mx-4">Last two characters = Feedback on your timing in returning to the correct position:</p><ul class="list-disc ml-8 mb-4 text-md"><li>E# indicates you were early where the number tells you how many frames you were early.</li><li>YY indicates you were on time. If you did not get the crystal flash, it could mean you were not holding the correct inputs (you must hold only L, R, down, and shoot), or it could mean you did not meet the conditions for a crystal flash. You must have 10+ missiles, 10+ super missiles, 10+ power bombs, and be below 50 HP with empty reserves (having non-empty reserves to manual will prevent a crystal flash). It is often stated that you need 11+ power bombs, but that is counting the power bomb you laid at the beginning of the crystal flash clip attempt.</li><li>L# indicates you were late where the number tells you how many frames you were late.</li></ul><p class="mx-4">Note: If using the bombs method, there is a two-frame window where Samus will reach the correct position with 0 speed for two frames. In this case, you will get your best case feedback. For example, instead of seeing YYL2 followed by YYL3, you will just see YYL2.</p><h2 class="mx-2 text-lg font-bold mt-4">Aqueduct Snail Clip</h2><p class="mx-4">Provides feedback on attempts to stop a particular snail in a position where you can jump up and clip through pipes to reach the two Aqueduct items:<br/>

However because the snail moves 1.25 pixels per frame on NTSC and roughly 1.5 pixels per frame on PAL, it works out to only 3 frames on NTSC and 3 or 4 frames on PAL.  Without Hi-Jump Boots equipped, it&#x27;s only a 2-frame window on both NTSC and PAL.</p><h2 class="mx-2 text-lg font-bold mt-4">Mother Brain HP</h2><p class="mx-4">Displays the HP of the second enemy. Most useful for the Mother Brain fight since Mother Brain uses the second enemy slot.</p><h2 class="mx-2 text-lg font-bold mt-4">Ridley AI</h2><p class="mx-4">Prints the name of Ridley&#x27;s current AI routine on the bottom-right of the HUD to assist with finding manipulation strategies. Ridley&#x27;s HP is displayed on the left until it reaches zero, at which point it will start counting Ridley&#x27;s &quot;death grab&quot; attempts until Ridley explodes.</p><br/></div></div></div></div></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json">{"props":{"pageProps":{}},"page":"/infohudmode","query":{},"buildId":"q7prjm8C3VMRFOQIPIvh-","nextExport":true,"autoExport":true,"isFallback":false,"scriptLoader":[]}</script></body></html>
